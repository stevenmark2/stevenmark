    <p>As the size of electronic devices has decreased over time, their storage capacity has increased. An iPhone that fits in someone's pocket today can store more data than many gigantic vintage computers.  For this trend to continue, new data storage technology will be required.  Specifically, magnetic switching will need to give way to electrical switching, a more powerful technique for storing information. Studies in Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) have garnered significant attention in this ever-present drive for more efficient data storage technology. SOT utilizes power from an electric current to generate a spin current in a heavy metal. This current can switch the magnetization in an adjacent ferromagnet. This study used SOT to compare different thin films composed of Pt/Co/Al2O3 (Film 1), and Pt/EuS(1nm)/Al2O3 (Film 2). These metals were chosen because of their magnetic properties, which are essential for efficient data storage. These samples were made using E-beam evaporation and patterned using E-beam lithography. After wire-bonding the samples, the samples were connected to a PPMS to measure how they respond to applied magnetic fields which analyzed the films' resistance. </p>
    <p>The experiment found that, as the temperature decreased, the hysteresis of Film 1, showing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, became more pronounced. In addition, the sample with EuS showed signatures of SOT in the second harmonic while the sample without EuS did not. Also, the hysteresis of Film 1 displayed a two-step property despite the ultra-thin nature of the cobalt layer. This phenomenon indicates that the cobalt layer magnetized the platinum layer, and because the latter is softer than the cobalt, it resulted in in the two-step hysteresis that was measured. This research is important for advancing non-volatile storage, especially in MRAM. By optimizing SOT, MRAM could potentially revolutionize how people store information and pave the way for advancements in the field of spintronics.   <p>I worked hands-on with sputtering, magnetic measurements, and data analysis to evaluate performance across materials.</p>
