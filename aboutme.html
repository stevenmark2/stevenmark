    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Steven Wimberly, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. Originally from Houston, I love exploring how engineering, physics, and computer science can solve real-world problems. Outside of class and the lab, I enjoy running, listening to music, eating food and building cool things from scratch.</p>
    <p>This website highlights some of my projects I've worked on, from research at MIT to senior thesis. Thanks for visiting!</p>
